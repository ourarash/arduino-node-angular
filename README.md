# Arduino-Node-Angular
A complete end-to-end starter project for send/receive commands from an Arduino board on web using Angular. 

This project consists of three parts:

1. [Arduino firmware](arduino)
2. [Node server](serial-websocket)
3. [Angular client](angular-websocket-client)

The arduino firmware and Node server should run on the same device. The Angular client can run on any web device that can connect to the Node server through network.
